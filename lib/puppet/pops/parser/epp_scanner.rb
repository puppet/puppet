require 'strscan'

# A scanner specialized in processing text with embedded EPP (Embedded Puppet) tags.
# The scanner is initialized with a StringScanner which it mutates as scanning takes place.
# The intent is to use one instance of EppScanner per wanted scan, and this instance represents
# the state after the scan.
#
# @example Sample usage
#   a = "some text <% pp code %> some more text"
#   scan = StringScanner.new(a)
#   eppscan = EppScanner.new(scan)
#   str = eppscan.scan
#   eppscan.mode # => :epp
#   eppscan.lines # => 0
#   eppscan
#
# The scanner supports
# * scanning text until <%, <%-, <%=
# * while scanning text:
#   * tokens <%% and %%> are translated to <% and %> respetively and is returned as text.
#   * tokens <%# and %> (or ending with -%>) and the enclosed text is a comment and is not included in the returned text
#   * text following a comment that ends with -%> gets trailing whitespace (up to and including a line break) trimmed
#     and this whitespace is not included in the returned text.
# * The continuation {#mode} is set to one of:
#   * `:epp` - for a <% token
#   * `:expr` - for a <%= token
#   * `:text` - when there was no continuation mode (e.g. when input ends with text)
#   * ':error` - if the tokens are unbalanced (reaching the end without a closing matching token). An error message
#     is then also available via the method {#message}.
#
# Note that the intent is to use this specialized scanner to scan the text parts, when continuation mode is `:epp` or `:expr`
# the pp lexer should advance scanning (using the string scanner) until it reaches and consumes a `-%>` or '%>Â´ token. If it
# finds a `-%> token it should pass this on as a `skip_leading` parameter when it performs the next {#scan}.
#
