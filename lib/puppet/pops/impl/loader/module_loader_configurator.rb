  # A ModuleLoaderConfigurator is responsible for configuring module loaders given a module path
  # NOTE: Exploratory code (not yet fully featured/functional) showing how a configurator loads and configures
  # ModuleLoaders for a given set of modules on a given module path.
  # 
  # ==Usage
  # Create an instance and for each wanted entry call one of the methods #add_all_modules,
  # or #add_module. A call must be made to #add_root (once only) to define where the root is.
  # 
  # The next step is to produce loaders for the modules. This involves resolving the modules dependencies
  # to know what is visible to each module (and later to create a real loader). This can be a quite heavy
  # operation and there may be many more modules available than what will actually be used.
  # The creation of loaders is therefore performed lazily.
  #
  # A call to #create_loaders sets up lazy loaders for all modules and creates the real loader for
  # the root.
