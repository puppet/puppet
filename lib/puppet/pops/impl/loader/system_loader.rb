# A System loader loads "evaluateable" files found relative to a set of given roots. The path relative to
# the root consists of the name segments in the given name.
# A System loader can scan one or multiple roots. Root pats are given as file system paths, or as
# URIs. The URI may have no scheme (interpreted as a file), file: scheme, or gem:. The gem: scheme allows 
# a symbolic reference to be made to the content of a gem.
#
# ==Gem Scheme
# When specifying a location relative to a gem, the scheme is given as 'gem:', and the hostname should
# be the name of the gem. This is all that is required if the root to use inside the gem is '<gemroot>/lib/puppet/'.
# If some other internal location should be used, it is specified as the path, and it must then be the complete
# relative path to where there are directories named 'types', 'functions', and/or possibly 'manifests'.
#
# e.g. The gem 'foo' has a type 'pineapple' located in '<gemroot>/lib/puppet/types/pops/pineapple.pp'. The
# location can then be specified with the uri 'gem://foo'. If the type instead is found under
# '<gemroot>/lin/foo/puppet/types/pops/pineapple.pp', the uri should be specified as 'gem://foo/lib/foo'.
#
# A search for a type will take place in the given order among the locations passed when instantiating
# the system loader. The first found will be used.
# If a name matches a file, it is expected to produce the given name when evaluated or an exception is raised.
# 
# NOTE: Currently the search is limited to 'puppet/types/pops' and 'puppet/functions/pops' 
# under a given location, and only for .pp
# file extension. TODO: This can be extended to allow other types of things to be loaded such as
# an .ecore model, content from .zip or .jar files, or .rb
#
# NOTE: A Loader could be extended with other schemes, if remote fetching is wanted; i.e. download using
# http, https, etc. If this is done, a temporary location is required (to evaluate the file), and its
# origin must then be passed to the evaluator as the temporary location would be meaningless to users
# in error messages (the current method does not take an additional 'origin' which would be required).
