module Puppet::Pops::Binder
  # Producer is an abstract base class representing the base contract for a bound producer.
  # This class is used internally when an explicit producer is wanted (i.e. when looking up
  # a producer instead of an instance).
  #
  # Custom Producers
  # ----------------
  # The intent is also that this class is derived for custom producers that require additional
  # arguments when producing an instance. Such a custom producer may raise an error if called
  # with too few arguments, or may implement specific produce methods and always raise an
  # error on #produce indicating that this producer requires custom calls and that it can not
  # be used as an implicit producer.

    # to perform initialization/refresh of its internal state. This method is called when
    # a producer is requested.
