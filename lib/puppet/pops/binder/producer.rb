module Puppet::Pops::Binder
  # Producer is an abstract base class representing the base contract for a bound producer.
  # This class is used internally when an explicit producer is wanted (i.e. when looking up
  # a producer instead of an instance).
  #
  # Custom Producers
  # ----------------
  # The intent is also that this class is derived for custom producers that require additional
  # arguments when producing an instance. Such a custom producer may raise an error if called
  # with too few arguments, or may implement specific produce methods and always raise an
  # error on #produce indicating that this producer requires custom calls and that it can not
  # be used as an implicit producer.
  #

  class Producer

    # @param scope [Puppet::Parser:Scope] the scope to use for evaluation
    # @param *args [Object] arguments to custom producers, always empty for implicit productions
    # @return [Object] the produced instance (should never be nil).
