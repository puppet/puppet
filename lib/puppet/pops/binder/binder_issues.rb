module Puppet::Pops::Binder::BinderIssues

  # NOTE: The methods #issue and #hard_issue are done in a somewhat funny way
  # since the Puppet::Pops::Issues is a module with these methods defined on the module-class
  # This makes it hard to inherit them in this module. (Likewise if Issues was a class, and they
  # need to be defined for the class, and such methods are also not inherited, it becomes more
  # difficult to reuse these. It did not seem as a good idea to refactor Issues at this point
  # in time - they should both probably be refactored once bindings support is finished.
  # Meanwhile, they delegate to Issues.

  # TODO: This class is just starting its life. Most notably there is no way to give more detailed
  # information about a binding - this remains to be designed.
