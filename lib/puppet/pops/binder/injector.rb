# The injector is the "lookup service" class
#
# Initialization
# --------------
# The injector is initialized with a configured Binder. The Binder instance contains a resolved set of key => "binding information"
# that is used to setup the injector.
#
# Lookup
# ------
# It is possible to lookup the value, or a producer of the value. The #lookup method looks up a value, and the
# #lookup_producer looks up a producer.
# Both of these methods can be called with three different signatures; #lookup(key), #lookup(type, name), and #lookup(name),
# and #lookup_producer(key), #lookup_producer(type, name), and #lookup_producer(name).
#
# Singleton or Not
# ----------------
# The lookup of a value is based on the lookup of a producer. For singleton producers this means that the value is
# determined by the first value lookup. Subsequent lookups via either method will produce the same instance.
#
# Non singleton producers will produce a new instance on each request for a value. For constant value producers this
# means that a new deep-clone is produced for mutable objects (but not for immutable objects as this is not needed).
# Custom producers should have non singleton behavior, or if this is not possible ensure that the produced result is
# immutable. (The behavior if a custom producer hands out a mutable value and this is mutated is undefined).
