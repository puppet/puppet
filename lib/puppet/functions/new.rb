# Creates a new instance/object of a given type.
#
# This functions makes it possible to create new instances of
# concrete types. If a block is given it is called with the
# just created instance as an argument.
#
# Calling this function is equivalent to directly
# calling the type:
#
# @ example new and calling type directly are equivalent
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $a = Integer.new("42")
# $b = Integer("42")
# ~~~
#
# This would convert the string "42" to the decimal value 42.
#
# @ example arguments by position or by name
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $a = Integer.new("42", 8)
# $b = Integer({from => "42", radix => 8})
# ~~~
#
# This would convert the octal (radix 8) number "42" in string form
# to the decimal value 34.
#
# The new function supports two ways of giving the arguments:
#
# * by name (using a hash with property to value mapping)
# * by position (as regular arguments)
#
# Note that it is not possible to create new instances of
# some abstract classes (e.g. `Variant`). The type Optional[T] is an
# exception as it will create an instance of T or `undef` if the
# value to convert is `undef`.
#
# The arguments that can be given to each type is
# determined by the type.
#
# An assertion is always made that
# the produced value complies with the given type constraints.
#
# @example type constraints are checked:
#
# ~~~ puppet
#  Integer[0].new("-100")
# ~~~
# 
# Would fail with an assertion error.
#
# The following sections show the arguments and conversion rules
# per type built into the Puppet Type System.
#
# Conversion to Optional[T] and NotUndef[T]
# -----------------------------------------
# Conversion to these types is the same as a conversion to the type argument `T`. In the case of `Optional[T]`
# it accepted that the result may be `undef` (i.e. not possible to convert).
#
# Conversion to Integer
# ---------------------
#
# A new `Integer` can be created from `Integer`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `String` values.
# For conversion `from` String it is possible to specify the radix. 
#
# ~~~ puppet
# type Radix = Variant[Default, Integer[2,2], Integer[8,8], Integer[10,10], Integer[16,16]]
# Callable[String, Radix, 1, 2]
# Callable[Variant[Numeric, Boolean]]
# ~~~
# 
# * When converting from String the default radix is 10
# * If radix is not specified an attempt is made to detect the radix from the start of the string:
#   * `0b` or `0B` is taken as radix 2, 
#   * `0x` or `0X` is taken as radix 16, 
#   * `0` as radix 8,
#   * all other are decimal 
# * Conversion from String accepts an optional sign in the string.
# * For hexadecimal (radix 16) conversion an optional leading "0x", or "0X" is accepted
# * for octal (radix 8) an optional leading "0" is accepted
# * for binary (radix 2) an optional leading "0b" or "0B" is accepted
# * When `radix` is set to `default`, the conversion is based on the leading
#   characters in the string. A leading "0" for radix 8, a leading "0x", or "0X" for
#   radix 16, and leading "0b" or "0B" for binary.
# * Conversion from Boolean results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.
# * Conversion from Integer, Float, and Boolean ignores the radix.
# * Float value fractions are truncated (no rounding)
#
# @example Converting to Integer
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $a_number = Integer("0xFF", 16)  # results in 255
# $a_number = Numeric("010")       # results in 8
# $a_number = Numeric("010", 10)   # results in 10
# $a_number = Integer("true")      # results in 1
# ~~~
#
# Conversion to Numeric
# ---------------------
#
# A new Integer or Float can be created from Integer, Float, Boolean and
# String values.
#
# ~~~ puppet
# Callable[Variant[Numeric, Boolean, String]]
# ~~~
#
# * If the value has a decimal period, or if given in scientific notation
#   (e/E), the result is a `Float`, otherwise the value is an `Integer`. The
#   conversion from `String` always uses a radix based on the prefix of the string.
# * Conversion from Boolean results in 0 for `false` and 1 for `true`.
#
# @example Converting to Numeric
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $a_number = Numeric("true")  # results in 1
# $a_number = Numeric("0xFF")  # results in 255
# $a_number = Numeric("010")   # results in 8
# $a_number = Numeric("3.14")  # results in 3.14 (a float)
# ~~~
# 
# Conversion to String
# --------------------
#
# Conversion to String is the most comprehensive conversion as there are many
# use cases where a String representation is wanted. The defaults for the many options
# have been chosen with care to be the most basic "value in textual form" representation.
#
# A new String can be created from all other data types. The process is performed in
# several steps - first the type of the given value is inferred, then the resulting type
# is used to find the most significant format specified for that type. And finally,
# the found format is used to convert the given value.
#
# The mapping from type to format is referred to as the format map. This map
# allows different formatting depending on type.
#
# @example Positive Integers in Hexadecimal prefixed with '0x', negative in Decimal
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $format_map = { Integer[default, 0] => "%d",
#   Integer[1, default] => "%#x"
# }
# String("-1", $format_map)  # produces '-1'
# String("10", $format_map)  # produces '0xa'
# ~~~
#
# A format is specified on the form:
#
# ~~~
# %[Flags][Width][.Precision]Format
# ~~~
#
# `Width` is the number of characters into which the value should be fitted. This allocated space is
# padded if value is shorter. By default it is space padded, and the flag 0 will cause padding with 0
# for numerical formats.
#
# `Precision` is the number of fractional digits to show for floating point, and the maximum characters
# included in a string format.
#
# Note that all data type supports the formats `s` and `p` with the meaning "default to string" and
# "default programmatic string representation" (which for example means that a String is quoted in 'p' format).
#
# ### Signatures of String conversion
#
# ~~~ puppet
# type Format = Pattern[/^%([\s\+\-#0\[\{<\(\|]*)([1-9][0-9]*)?(?:\.([0-9]+))?([a-zA-Z])/]
# type ContainerFormat = Struct[{
#   format         => Optional[String],
#   separator      => Optional[String],
#   separator2     => Optional[String],
#   string_formats => Hash[Type, Format]
#   }]
# type TypeMap = Hash[Type, Variant[Format, ContainerFormat]]
# type Formats = Variant[Default, String[1], TypeMap]
#
# Callable[Any, Formats]
# ~~~
#
# Where:
# * `separator` is the string used to separate entries in an array, or hash (extra space should not be included at
#   then end), defaults to `","`
# * `separator2` is the separator between key and value in a hash entry (space padding should be included as
#   wanted), defaults to `" => ".
# * `string_formats` is a type to format map for values contained in arrays and hashes - defaults to `{Any => "%p"}`. Note that
#   these nested formats are not applicable to containers which are always formatted as per the top level format specification.
#
# @example Simple Conversion to String (using defaults)
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $str = String(10)      # produces '10'
# $str = String([10])    # produces '["10"]'
# ~~~
#
# @example Simple Conversion to String specifying the format for the given value directly
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $str = String(10, "%#x")    # produces '0x10'
# $str = String([10], "%(a")  # produces '("10")'
# ~~~
#
# @example Specifying type for values contained in an array
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $formats = { Array => {format => '%(a', string_formats => { Integer => '%#x' } }
# $str = String([1,2,3], $formats) # produces '(0x1, 0x2, 0x3)'
# ~~~
#
# Given formats are merged with the default formats, and matching of values to convert against format is based on
# the specificity of the mapped type; for example, different formats can be used for short and long arrays.
#
# ### Integer to String
#
# | Format  | Integer Formats
# | ------  | ---------------
# | d       | Decimal, negative values produces leading '-'

# | d D       | 'default' or 'Default', alternative form # causes value to be quoted
# | s         | same as d
# | p         | same as d
#
# ### Array & Tuple to String
#
# | Format    | Array/Tuple Formats
# | ------    | -------------
# | a         | formats with `[ ]` delimiters and `,`, alternate form `#` indents nested arrays/hashes
# | s         | same as a
# | p         | same as a
#
# See "Flags" `<[({\|` for formatting of delimiters, and "Additional parameters for containers; Array and Hash" for
# more information about options.
#
# The alternate form flag `#` will cause indentation of nested array or hash containers. If width is also set
# it is taken as the maximum allowed length of a sequence of elements (not including delimiters). If this max length
# is exceeded, each element will be indented.
#
# ### Hash & Struct to String
#
# | Format    | Hash/Struct Formats
# | ------    | -------------

# | p         | same as h
# | a         | converts the hash to an array of [k,v] tuples and formats it using array rule(s)
# 
# See "Flags" `<[({\|` for formatting of delimiters, and "Additional parameters for containers; Array and Hash" for
# more information about options.
#
# The alternate form flag `#` will format each hash key/value entry indented on a separate line.
#
# ### Type to String
# 
# | Format    | Array/Tuple Formats
# | ------    | -------------
# | s         | The same as p, quoted if alternative flag # is used
# | p         | Outputs the type in string form as specified by the Puppet Language
#
# ### Flags
#
# | Flag     | Effect 
# | ------   | ------
# | (space)  | space instead of + for numeric output (- is shown), for containers skips delimiters
# | #        | alternate format; prefix 0x/0x, 0 (octal) and 0b/0B for binary, Floats force decimal '.'. For g/G keep trailing 0.
# | +        | show sign +/- depending on value's sign, changes x,X, o,b, B format to not use 2's complement form
# | -        | left justify the value in the given width
# | 0        | pad with 0 instead of space for widths larger than value
# | <[({\|   | defines an enclosing pair <> [] () {} or \| \| when used with a container type
#
# Conversion to Boolean
# ---
#
# Accepts a single value as argument:
# * Float 0.0 is `false`, all other float values are `true`
# * Integer 0 is `false`, all other integer values are `true`
# * Strings
#   * `true` if 'true', 'yes', 'y' (case independent compare)
#   * `false` if 'false', 'no', 'n' (case independent compare)
# * Boolean is already boolean and is simply returned
#
# Conversion to Array and Tuple
# ---
#
# When given a single value as argument:
#
# * A non empty `Hash` is converted to an array matching `Array[Tuple[Any,Any], 1]`
# * An empty `Hash` becomes an empty array
# * An `Array` is simply returned
# * An `Iterable[T]` is turned into an array of `T` instances
#
# When given a second Boolean argument
# * if `true`, a value that is not already an array is returned as a one element array
# * if `false`, (the default), converts the first argument as shown above.
#
# @example ensuring value is array
#
# ~~~ puppet
# $arr = Array($value, true)
# ~~~
#
# Conversion to a `Tuple` works exactly as conversion to an `Array`, only that the constructed array is
# asserted against the given tuple type.
#
# Conversion to Hash and Struct
# ---
# Accepts a single value as argument:
#
# * An empty `Array` becomes an empty hash
# * An `Array` matching `Array[Tuple[Any,Any], 1]` is converted to a hash where each tuple describes a key/value entry
# * An `Array` with an even number of entries is interpreted as `[key1, val1, key2, val2, ...]`
# * An `Iterable` is turned into an `Array` and then converted to hash as per the array rules
# * A `Hash` is simply returned
#
# Conversion to a `Struct` works exactly as conversion to a `Hash`, only that the constructed hash is
# asserted against the given struct type.
