    summary "Examine Puppet's current configuration options"
    description <<-EOT
      Prints the value of a single configuration option or a list of
      configuration options.

      This action is an alternate interface to the information available with
      `puppet agent --configprint`.
    EOT
    notes <<-EOT
      The return data of this action varies depending on its arguments. When
      called with "all," `print` will return a complete list of option names
      and values. When called with a single configuration option name, it will
      return the value of that option. When called with a list of
      configuration option names, it will return the corresponding list of
      option names and values.

      By default, this action retrieves its configuration information in agent
      mode. To examine the master's configuration, supply Puppet's global
      `--mode master` option. To examine configurations from a specific
      environment, you can use the `--environment` option.
    EOT
    examples <<-EOT
      Get puppet's runfile directory:

      Get a list of important directories from the master's config:

          puppet config print all --mode master | grep -E "(path|dir)"
