  summary "View puppet server status"
  description <<-EOT
    This subcommand is only useful for determining whether a puppet master
    server (or an agent node, if puppet was started with the `--listen`
    option) is responding to requests.

    Only the `find` action is valid. If the server is responding to
    requests, `find` will retrieve a status object; if not, the connection
    will be refused. When invoked with the `local` terminus, `find` will
    always return true.

    If you wish to query a server other than the master configured in
    puppet.conf, you must set the `--server` and `--masterport` options on
    the command line.
  EOT

    destroy actions for an indirected subsystem of Puppet. Valid terminuses
    for this face include:

    * `local`
    * `rest`
