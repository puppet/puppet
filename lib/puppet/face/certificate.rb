  summary "Provide access to the CA for certificate management"
  description <<-EOT
    This face interacts with a local or remote Puppet certificate
    authority. Currently, its behavior is not a full superset of puppet
    cert; specifically, it is unable to mimic puppet cert's "clean" option,
    and its "generate" action submits a CSR rather than creating a
    signed certificate.

    This is an indirector face, which exposes find, search, save, and

    summary "Generate a new certificate signing request for HOST"
    description <<-EOT
      Generates and submits a certificate signing request (CSR) for the
      provided host identifier. This CSR will then have to be signed by a user
      with the proper authorization on the certificate authority.

      Puppet agent handles CSR submission automatically. This action is
      primarily useful for requesting certificates for individual users and
      external applications.
