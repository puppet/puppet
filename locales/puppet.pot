#. Return a list of all applications (both legacy and Face applications), along with a summary
#. of their functionality.
#. @return [Array] An Array of Arrays.  The outer array contains one entry per application; each
#. element in the outer array is a pair whose first element is a String containing the application
#. name, and whose second element is a String containing the summary for that application.
#. Now we find the line with our summary, extract it, and return it.  This
#. depends on the implementation coincidence of how our pages are
#. formatted.  If we can't match the pattern we expect we return the empty
#. string to ensure we don't blow up in the summary. --daniel 2011-04-11
