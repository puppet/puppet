.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-filebucket\fR \- Store and retrieve files in a filebucket
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
A stand\-alone Puppet filebucket client\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
puppet filebucket \fImode\fR [\-h|\-\-help] [\-V|\-\-version] [\-d|\-\-debug] [\-v|\-\-verbose] [\-l|\-\-local] [\-r|\-\-remote] [\-s|\-\-server \fIserver\fR] [\-f|\-\-fromdate \fIdate\fR] [\-t|\-\-todate \fIdate\fR] [\-b|\-\-bucket \fIdirectory\fR] \fIfile\fR \fIfile\fR \.\.\.
.
.P
Puppet filebucket can operate in three modes, with only one mode per call:
.
.P
backup: Send one or more files to the specified file bucket\. Each sent file is printed with its resulting md5 sum\.
.
.P
get: Return the text associated with an md5 sum\. The text is printed to stdout, and only one file can be retrieved at a time\.
.
.P
restore: Given a file path and an md5 sum, store the content associated with the sum into the specified file path\. You can specify an entirely new path to this argument; you are not restricted to restoring the content to its original location\.
.
.P
diff: Print a diff in unified format between two checksums in the filebucket or between a checksum and its matching file\.
.
.P
list: List all files in the current local filebucket\. Listing remote filebuckets is not allowed\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is a stand\-alone filebucket client for sending files to a local or central filebucket\.
.
.P
Note that \'filebucket\' defaults to using a network\-based filebucket available on the server named \'puppet\'\. To use this, you\'ll have to be running as a user with valid Puppet certificates\. Alternatively, you can use your local file bucket by specifying \'\-\-local\'\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument\. For example, \'ssldir\' is a valid setting, so you can specify \'\-\-ssldir \fIdirectory\fR\' as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at https://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/puppet/latest/reference/configuration\.html for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet with \'\-\-genconfig\'\.
.
.TP
\-\-debug

.TP
\-\-fromdate
